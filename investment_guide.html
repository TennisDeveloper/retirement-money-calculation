        <p>Usually, there are two groups of people. People who are passionate about 
            investing and want to learn how to be successful. They usually invest actively, 
            e.g. they actively select individual stocks to buy. Or they buy real estate or 
            other asset classes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>The second category usually is the people, who do not have either time 
            or passion for investing. But they still realize that investing money 
            is important. Otherwise, inflation might destroy the purchasing power 
            of their savings.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>The following sections explain the most successful strategy for people, 
            who don't want to spend 20 hours per week studying financial statements 
            but still want to implement a successful investment strategy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <h2>Are investments too complicated?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>Yes, it is a kind of art to be successful. Even the most intelligent people lost money
             while investing. But there is still one strategy, which could be applied with a minimum 
             amount of mouse clicks and it is very easy to understand. This is called dollar-cost averaging. 
             This means, that you will invest the same amount of money each month in the index funds.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>An index fund invests in a  broad range of stocks based on the rule. E.g. one of the most known is 
            S&P 500. This index fund always holds the 500 biggest US companies. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>If there is a company on the US market included in the index, which price significantly drops, 
            this company will be dropped out of the index. The company will be replaced by another one. 
            You can imagine that this index always holds the 500 biggest or most expensive companies in 
            the US market. Therefore, if you buy an index fund you always hold the biggest 500 companies. 
            You do not need to follow any news or read financial statements. Just simply each month you buy 
            the 500 biggest companies via the ETF investment product.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>And now the best news! This strategy in the long term usually beats most portfolio managers of 
            actively managed funds, which try to pick individual stocks. But you need to follow it for at 
            least 20 years. And be disciplined. And before you open an account with any broker, check the 
            fees. Important is that you do not pay more than a 1% fee for each buy transaction of an index 
            fund. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <h2>Can I lose money with an index fund?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>Investment is always the question of probability. 
            If the probability of success is on your side then you will not lose the money. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>You will be successful with index fund investments if you do it on a monthly or 
            quarterly basis and at least 20 years. Of course, during the short-term period, 
            you can see some decrease in your invested money, but if you do not sell your position, 
            you will not lose money. Just keep investing.  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>The long-term average return of the S&P 500 is approximately 6-7% per year. 
            The more you can invest each month the better your long-term result will be. 
            Just have a look at the calculator and play with it. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>You have other advantages as well. This strategy can be implemented easily by yourself, 
            you do not need any portfolio manager! That means you do not need to rely on anyone else 
            than you. Probably you have heard many stories, of how portfolio managers' strategies led 
            to fraud issues. Unfortunately, there are many more immoral portfolio managers out there. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>Therefore the probability, that you will lose your money if you send it to some investment 
            company is very high. Unless you understand very well what they do and know them for many 
            years. One last note on actively managed funds. The fees are much higher than 1%. Usually, 
            you pay some fixed fees of around 1% every year of the amount of your invested money. This 
            will be paid anyway, even if your manager would face a loss during the year. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>In case your portfolio manager earns some profit for you, you will pay another "performance fee". 
            This can be between 5 to 20%, depending on the fund and strategy. The portfolio manager of the 
            fund where you have invested can change as well. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>Those portfolio managers who are great are completely fanatical about the markets. They live for 
            investments and always think about it. They have all the money invested with your money as 
            well in the same fund. They are moral and humble, they can recognize their own mistakes as well. 
            They learn constantly. They do not change their strategy and can explain it easily. And they don't 
            charge high fees. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p>As you can see, is not that easy to select the portfolio manager.  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre_calculator_area">
        <p >On the other hand, what do you risk with index funds? With index fund investing, you can forget this risk 
            of losing everything because you gave your money to someone who was not moral enough. You control everything. 
            Therefore you need to have two very important characteristics: patience and discipline. 
        </p>
